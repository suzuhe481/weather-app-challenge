# Frontend Mentor - Weather App Challenge

This is my solution to the [Weather app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/weather-app-K1FhddVm49). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. This is my first hackathon project where I hope to practice my frontend skills and establish my own workflow to mimic a real work scenario.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for weather information by entering a location in the search bar
- View current weather conditions including temperature, weather icon, and location details
- See additional weather metrics like "feels like" temperature, humidity percentage, wind speed, and precipitation amounts
- Browse a 7-day weather forecast with daily high/low temperatures and weather icons
- View an hourly forecast showing temperature changes throughout the day
- Switch between different days of the week using the day selector in the hourly forecast section
- Toggle between Imperial and Metric measurement units via the units dropdown
- Switch between specific temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit) and measurement units for wind speed (km/h and mph) and precipitation (millimeters) via the units dropdown
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

### Built with

- React
- Tailwind
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Responsive Web Design

### What I Learned

I'm using this opportunity to practice creating a frontend from a given design. I want to test my accuracy in replicating an app, similarly to a real work environment. To accomplish this, I'm focusing on planning first, and coding second. By organizing what I need to do and how to do it, I hope to encounter less problems during this challenge, and be quicker in implenting my solution.

### Continued Development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
