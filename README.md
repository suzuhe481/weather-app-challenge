# Frontend Mentor - Weather App Challenge

This is my solution to the [Weather app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/weather-app-K1FhddVm49). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. This is my first hackathon project where I hope to practice my frontend skills and establish my own workflow to mimic a real work scenario.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for weather information by entering a location in the search bar
- View current weather conditions including temperature, weather icon, and location details
- See additional weather metrics like "feels like" temperature, humidity percentage, wind speed, and precipitation amounts
- Browse a 7-day weather forecast with daily high/low temperatures and weather icons
- View an hourly forecast showing temperature changes throughout the day
- Switch between different days of the week using the day selector in the hourly forecast section
- Toggle between Imperial and Metric measurement units via the units dropdown
- Switch between specific temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit) and measurement units for wind speed (km/h and mph) and precipitation (millimeters) via the units dropdown
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

### Built with

- React
- Tailwind
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Responsive Web Design

### What I Learned

I'm using this opportunity to practice creating a frontend from a given design. I want to test my accuracy in replicating an app, similarly to a real work environment. To accomplish this, I'm focusing on planning first, and coding second. By organizing what I need to do and how to do it, I hope to encounter less problems during this challenge, and be quicker in implenting my solution.
